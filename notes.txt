Just realized that collision detection (namely getting the real bounding box of the object) works against expected behavior under the following condition: 
A Drawable is rotated some ammount such that rotation % 90 != 0. That Drawable is in a Group which has different x and y scales.
Under these conditions the visual rectangular bounding box of the Drawable is actually skewed into what I assume is a parallelogram.
Currently the get real bounding box method of the Drawable assumes that Drawables remain as rectangles under all available transformations.
Since this isn't true there are some options:

1. Approximate these parallelograms as rotated rectangles, this leads to incorrect and strange results but requires very little modification.
2. Change the get real bounding box method to not return a bounding box but instead points representing the parellelogram/rectangular shape.
And modify the SAT collision algorithm to accomodate parallelograms, may as well make it work with any convex polygon. This lowers performance
but garauntees accuracy to the visual item. This also makes the get real bounding box method a direct mirror of the "get mouse coordinates in world" type function
which should be easy to make by reversing this. In this case all I need is something that gets the position of a point in the parent group.
3. Do nothing. It makes sense to only accomodate rectangular bounding boxes but this will result in very incorrect results in many cases. 
I don't like this option but it's what I should do in this case because I am trying to put development of the game ahead of Ocru.

Going to take a break for now. Was working on getting where the mouse is in the world before I got sucked into looking at the existing collisions.
